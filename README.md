## Overview 
    
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Canalyst is a cloud-based vendor providing access to a propietary database of equity research models to its subscribers. The company was incorporated in 2015 by a former buy-side analyst, James Rife, in Vancouver, BC. James developed the first models as a personal tool to swiftly run his own companies analysis and compare them. The company was established after interest sparked from other fellow practitioners. Canalyst has undergone various financing rounds to date. Notably, WorldQuant, a reknowned US-based quantitative hedge fund participated in its Series A financing back in 2017. However the investment amount was not disclosed. The company also raised \$2.7M from Vanedge Capital in 2016 in its first seed round of financing. On their most recent round of financing, the company raised an additional \$20M in a series B. Canalyst is estimated to have raised almost \$30 million since its inception.</p>

## Business activity

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Canalyst's value proposition lies on their ability to provide cloud-based access to more than 4000+ propietary excel workbook models of North American listed companies. Their product is differentiated from their closest competitors in that they are focused on simply building company models that are very thorough, insightful and are updated by in near real-time using primary sources of information. At an annual subscription fee in the range of \$10K to \$20K their solution is also price competitive when compared to other cloud-based research providers with estimated annual subscription fees costing north of \$20000.00. The company's product is an outsourced solution for firms that would otherwise need deploy limited resources toward building and maintaining their own models in-house. </p>

## Market analysis
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Canalyst subscribers are made up of mid to large size insitutional players in the asset management business within the capital markets space. Collectively known as the 'buy-side.' Catalyst caters fundamentally to Analysts, Directors of Research, Asset Managers, Hedge Funds and corporate Chief Investment Officers. A useful metric for gauging the size and potential of the 'buy-side' market is by looking at the level of assets under management (AuM) in the industry. The Boston Consulting Group estimated the size of the North American market to be around \$50 trillion as of July this year. With public North American equities presumably representing a sizable portion of the financial assets being managed. Although the market is significant, practitioners in this space also count with a slew of options to access investment related intelligence. Historically, they've resorted to traditional sources of market data such as company's financial statements, propietary models, and costly solutions like the long-established Bloomberg terminal. However, with the advent of 'alternative data sources', modern solutions are becoming more common place with buy-side firms making heavy investments in this area. Statista, a reknowed data company, reported an increase of almost 70% in investments into these type of data sources globally. With 2020 investments topping \$1.7 billion. Closed competitors to Canalyst also offering cloud-based services such as AI-powered research search engines have become notorious in this space. Among such other providers with similar SaaS business models are AIphasense, Sentieo and S&P Capital IQ. </p>

## Performance 

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The company has not reveal any detailed financial results on their operations as it is still privately-held, similar to some of its closest competitors. Nevertheless, some information exists that provide a glimpse into the level of success the company has experienced recently. An example is the growth in their employee base, which is reported to have grown 40% just over the past year, a higher rate than those experienced by popular competitors like Alphasense with a 22% growth. Canalyst employee head count sits at 100+ people making Canalyst a midsize firm just 6 years into the business. Based on a Globe and Mail write-up of the company, Canalyst topline approximated \$5 million by the end of 2019 and was doubling with each passing year. </p>

## Business recommendation

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Canalyst continues to have room for revenue growth within the institutional market of buy-side firms that is dedicated to managing equity portfolios. However, a greater chunk of assets under management in the industry is actually allocated toward fixed income securities. A vastly larger asset class by capitalisation and also in number of issues. SIFMA's 2021 Capital Market reports dislcosed that in the US alone fixed income issuances throughtout 2020 amounted up to \$12 trillion compared to a shy \$390 billion in equity issuances. That being said, managers browsing through the North American fixed income market could profit from modeling solutions that assists them in evaluating the enormous universe of debt issues as well. To add to that, it is likely that active managers within this asset class would be very motivated to get their hands on tools that can help them locate higher returning issues that have the potential to bolster their risk-adjusted performances in the midst of the current ultra low (and ultra unattractive!) interest rate environment.
